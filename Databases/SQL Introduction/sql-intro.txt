SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition language and a data manipulation language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.

Data manipulation
 - The Data Manipulation Language (DML) is the subset of SQL used to add, update and delete data:
	-Insert adds rows
	-Update modifies rows
	-Delete removes rows

Data definition
 - The Data Definition Language (DDL) manages table and index structure. The most basic items of DDL are the CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, DROP and TRUNCATE statements:

	- Create creates a object (table, view, func) in the db
	-Alter modifies the structure of an object(table, view, func)
	-Truncate deletes all date from a table
	-Drop deletes an object(table, view, func)
