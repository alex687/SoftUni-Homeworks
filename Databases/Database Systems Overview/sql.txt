1. What is SQL

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard computer language for relational database management and data manipulation. SQL is used to query, insert, update and modify data. Most relational databases support SQL, which is an added benefit for database administrators (DBAs), as they are often required to support databases across several different platforms.

2. What type of language is SQL

Yes, SQL is a language
As the SQL acronym pronounces, it is a language. It offers looping, logic directives, variables, and so on. Now, it’s not a language in the same sense as, say, Java or C++: SQL is considered a fourth-generation language (4GL), whereas Java and C++ are third-generation languages (3GLs).

Fourth-generation languages are programming languages that are closer to human language than high-level languages like Java. These 4GLs are often used to access databases, such as SQL, where humanlike syntax is used to retrieve and manipulate data.

SQL may not be a language on par with Java or C#, but it is a language. This is often a moot argument with Visual Basic or C developers. They refute the claim by stating that SQL is not compiled and offers little functionality compared to a 3GL.

SQL Commands:
The standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and DROP. These commands can be classified into groups based on their nature:

DDL - Data Definition Language:
Command	Description
CREATE	Creates a new table, a view of a table, or other object in database
ALTER	Modifies an existing database object, such as a table.
DROP	Deletes an entire table, a view of a table or other object in the database.

DML - Data Manipulation Language:
Command	Description
SELECT	Retrieves certain records from one or more tables
INSERT	Creates a record
UPDATE	Modifies records
DELETE	Deletes records

DCL - Data Control Language:
Command	Description
GRANT	Gives a privilege to user
REVOKE	Takes back privileges granted from user
